//You are given as standard input the number of employees in a company, the first names of two selected employees in a
//company, and the direct line management relations between every employee. Each person in the company can directly
//line manage a maximum of 2 other employees. The input has the following format: * on the first line, the number of
// unique employees in the company * on the second line, the name of the first selected employee (a first name only without spaces)
// * on the third line, the name of the second selected employee (a first name only without spaces, guaranteed to be different
// from the first selected employee) * on the subsequent lines, the line management relations in the format "EmployeeX EmployeeY" -
// meaning EmployeeX manages EmployeeY (first names without spaces and spaces are used to separate the two names)

//The input is correct (there are only direct line management relations, no cycles, all employees appear in the input).
// For simplicity, the first line after the selected employees (line 4) always contains the manager at the top of the hierarchy.
// Write a program that reads the input from stdin and then outputs out the name of the single employee at the lowest
// point in the hierarchy to which the two selected employees report, either directly or indirectly.
// If one employee reports to the other, either directly or indirectly, print out the name of the highest of the two selected employees.
//E.G
//INPUT (OUTPUT=Fred)
//6
//Hilary
//James
//Sarah Fred
//Sarah Paul
//Fred Hilary
//Fred Jenny
//Jenny James
